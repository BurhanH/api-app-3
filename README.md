# api-app-3
REST API app (Python 3.7.3 + Flask 1.1.1)

The main purpose was to build REST API. Definitely instead data file I should use database (probably it would be in next release).

Currently this service available on Heroku [https://api-flask-baur.herokuapp.com/](https://api-flask-baur.herokuapp.com/)

Next steps (08/24/2019) are - add documentation, make a homepage more pretty, and write some tests.
